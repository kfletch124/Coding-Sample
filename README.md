# Coding-Sample

This is a sample of a small project I did with a data set I found online that looked interesting. 
In this code I create two regression models and a plot of the dependent data.

The dataset was created by Angeliki Xifara (angxifara '@' gmail.com, Civil/Structural Engineer) and 
was processed by Athanasios Tsanas (tsanasthanasis '@' gmail.com, Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, University of Oxford, UK).
