# Coding-Sample

This is a sample of a small project I did with a data set I found online that looked interesting. 
In this code I create two regression models and a plot of the dependent data.

The data takes a variety of feactures in buildings such as surface area of the building and height and we want to use them to predict the heating and cooling load.

The dataset was created by Angeliki Xifara (angxifara '@' gmail.com, Civil/Structural Engineer) and 
was processed by Athanasios Tsanas (tsanasthanasis '@' gmail.com, Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, University of Oxford, UK).
